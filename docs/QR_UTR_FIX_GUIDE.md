# ✅ QR Code UTR Requirement Fixed - Testing Guide

## 🎉 **QR Code UTR Requirement Now Working!**

The UTR requirement for QR code payments has been successfully fixed. Now all UPI payment methods (QR code, app-based, and manual) require UTR validation.

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

### **Root Issues:**
- **Missing Payment Method:** QR code and UPI app buttons didn't set `paymentMethod = 'UPI'`
- **Case Mismatch:** Payment method values were inconsistent ('upi' vs 'UPI')
- **Validation Skip:** UTR validation only worked for manually selected UPI, not QR/app flows

### **Solutions Implemented:**
1. **✅ QR Code Fix:** `handleQRScan()` now sets `paymentMethod = 'UPI'`
2. **✅ UPI Apps Fix:** `handleUPIPayment()` now sets `paymentMethod = 'UPI'`
3. **✅ Consistent Values:** All payment method values standardized to 'UPI' and 'Bank Transfer'
4. **✅ Universal Validation:** UTR requirement now applies to ALL UPI payment flows
